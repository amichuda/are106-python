Since doing complication operations are important for us when working with data, we need a way around this. One way to solve this problem is to explicitly put a loop in the function.\n",

This is a bit complicated, but listen up: what you're going to do is take the function you wrote for Question 3, but assume that `x` (the input) isn't meant to be some number, but rather that `x` is a list. And what can we do with lists, use them in our loop as the thing we iterate over. So if we assume that `x` is a list and not just some number, can you rewrite the function from Question 3 to take in a list as an input and then output that list squared? Let's use `a=[1,2,3]` as our candidate list.\n",

Since there are sometimes very specialized functions for things, if Python had to include web development AND linear regression into the standard library, as well as other things, Python would become super big.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, however, it is easy to install new \"packages\" and \"libraries\" for Python. Your Anaconda distribution already has a lot of libraries that we'll need for the course, so you don't really need to install them, just `import` them. \n",

    "All an import is is that you have to put the command in a script you're writing to tell Python that you want to use that library as well as the standard library. So simply adding `import numpy` in your script will tell Python that you want to use `numpy`. \n",
